# VoiceText

A macOS menubar speech-to-text application. Hold a hotkey to record, release to transcribe and automatically type the result into the active application.

- **Offline-first**: Uses [FunASR](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR) ONNX models by default — no cloud dependency
- **Multi-backend**: Supports FunASR (Chinese-optimized) and [MLX-Whisper](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/whisper) (99 languages, Apple Silicon GPU)
- **AI Enhancement**: Optional LLM-powered text proofreading, formatting, completion, and translation via OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Vocabulary Retrieval**: Personal vocabulary index with embedding-based retrieval to improve correction of proper nouns and domain terms
- **Conversation History**: Injects recent confirmed outputs into the AI prompt for topic continuity and consistent entity resolution
- **Lightweight**: Runs as a menubar-only app (hidden from Dock)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Build as macOS App (Recommended)

For daily use, build VoiceText as a native macOS app bundle — no terminal needed after installation.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd VoiceText
uv sync
uv run pyinstaller VoiceText.spec
```

The built `VoiceText.app` will be in the `dist/` directory. Drag it to `/Applications` and launch like any other app.

> Alternatively, build with py2app: `uv run python setup.py py2app`

### Option 2: Run from Source (Development)

If you want to modify the code or debug, run directly with `uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Airead/VoiceText
cd VoiceText
uv sync

# Run
uv run python -m voicetext

# Run with a custom config file
uv run python -m voicetext path/to/config.json
```

### Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon recommended for MLX-Whisper)
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended package manager)

ASR models will be downloaded automatically on first launch (FunASR ~500 MB cached in `~/.cache/modelscope/`, MLX-Whisper models cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`).

### Permissions

On first launch the app will prompt for:

- **Microphone** — for audio recording
- **Accessibility** — for typing text into other applications

## Usage

1. The app starts with a **VT** icon in the menubar.
2. Hold the hotkey (default: `fn`) to record.
3. Release to transcribe — the recognized text is typed into the active window.

### Menubar Controls

- **ASR Model**: Switch between FunASR and MLX-Whisper models at runtime (models download on first use with progress display)
- **AI Enhance**: Toggle enhancement modes and select provider/model
- **Log Path**: Copy log file path to clipboard for debugging

## ASR Backends

### FunASR (default)

Offline Chinese speech recognition using ONNX models. Includes voice activity detection (VAD) and automatic punctuation restoration.

### MLX-Whisper

OpenAI Whisper running on Apple Metal GPU via MLX. Supports 99 languages with multiple model sizes:

| Preset | Model | Size |
|--------|-------|------|
| Whisper tiny | `mlx-community/whisper-tiny` | ~75 MB |
| Whisper base | `mlx-community/whisper-base` | ~140 MB |
| Whisper small | `mlx-community/whisper-small` | ~460 MB |
| Whisper medium | `mlx-community/whisper-medium` | ~1.5 GB |
| Whisper large-v3-turbo | `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` | ~1.6 GB |

## AI Text Enhancement

Optional post-processing of transcribed text using any OpenAI-compatible API (cloud or local like [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)).

### Enhancement Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Off | No enhancement |
| Proofread | Fix typos, grammar, and punctuation |
| Format | Convert spoken language to written form |
| Complete | Complete incomplete sentences |
| Enhance | Full enhancement (all of the above) |
| Translate to English | Translate Chinese text to English |

### Multi-Provider Support

Configure multiple LLM providers and switch between them at runtime from the menubar. Each provider supports:

- Custom base URL and API key
- Multiple models per provider
- Provider-specific `extra_body` parameters
- Optional extended thinking mode
- Configurable timeout

Providers can be added, removed, and verified directly from the menubar UI.

### Vocabulary Retrieval

VoiceText can build a personal vocabulary index from your correction history to improve recognition of proper nouns, technical terms, and domain-specific words. When enabled, relevant vocabulary entries are retrieved via embedding similarity and injected into the LLM prompt as context.

- **Build**: Click **AI Enhance > Build Vocabulary...** to extract terms from `corrections.jsonl` using LLM
- **Toggle**: Click **AI Enhance > Vocabulary** to enable/disable retrieval during enhancement
- Uses `fastembed` with a multilingual embedding model for local, offline semantic matching

See [docs/vocabulary-embedding-retrieval.md](docs/vocabulary-embedding-retrieval.md) for detailed design and motivation.

### Conversation History

VoiceText can inject recent conversation history into the AI enhancement prompt, enabling the LLM to understand the current topic and resolve recurring entities consistently. For example, if the user confirmed "萍萍" in a previous turn, subsequent ASR errors like "平平" can be correctly resolved.

- **Toggle**: Click **AI Enhance > Conversation History** to enable/disable
- Only preview-confirmed records (where the user reviewed and approved the output) are injected — ensuring data quality
- Token-efficient format: identical ASR/output shown once, corrections shown with arrow notation (e.g., `平平 → 萍萍`)

See [docs/conversation-history-enhancement.md](docs/conversation-history-enhancement.md) for detailed design and motivation.

## Configuration

Default config path: `~/.config/VoiceText/config.json`. Pass a JSON config file as a command-line argument to override. Only the fields you want to change are needed; everything else uses defaults.

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full default configuration, all available options, and environment variables.

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Logging

Logs are saved to `~/Library/Logs/VoiceText/voicetext.log` with rotation (5 MB per file, 3 backups). The log path can be copied from the menubar menu.
