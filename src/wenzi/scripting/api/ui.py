        The panel is not shown until ``panel.show()`` is called.

        Provide either *html* (a string) or *html_file* (a path to an HTML
        file on disk).  When *html_file* is used, the file is loaded directly
        via ``loadFileURL`` — no temp file is created, and the file's
        directory is automatically granted read access.

        Args:
            title: Window title.
            html: Initial HTML content string.
            html_file: Path to an HTML file to load directly.
            width: Default width in pixels.
            height: Default height in pixels.
            resizable: Whether the window can be resized.
            allowed_read_paths: Directories the WebView can read via file://.
            titlebar_hidden: Hide the native title bar and traffic light
                buttons so the web content fills the entire window.

        Returns:
            A :class:`WebViewPanel` instance.
